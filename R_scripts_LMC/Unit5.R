# The probability that a woman has breast cancer is 1% ("prevalence")

# If a woman has breast cancer, the probability that she tests positive is 90% ("sensitivity")

# If a woman does not have breast cancer, the probability that she nevertheless tests positive 
#is 9% ("false alarm rate")
# 
# In one session, almost half the group of 160 gynaecologists responded that the 
# woman's chance of having cancer was nine in 10.‚Äù [21% chose the right answer.]
