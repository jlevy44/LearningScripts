<h2>Kognito @ Cal Mission Statement</h2>
</center>
<h3>Information About Program</h3>
<p>Kognito is a 30 minute online interactive program that teaches students to
  recognize signs of depression and suicide in their peers, how to approach them
   and converse with them about it, and how to point them to relevant campus
   resources. For more information, see <a href="https://kognito.com/products/at-risk-for-college-students">Kognito</a>.</p>
<h3>Projected Impacts:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Give students tools to recognize and address signs of mental illnesses in themselves and others. </li>
  <li>Encourage students to reach out to struggling peers rather than staying silent.</li>
  <li>Increase referrals to psychological services on and off campus.</li>
  <li>Reduce the stigma surrounding mental health and illness on campus.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mission Statement:</h3>
<p> Our mission is to convince 1,500 UC Berkeley students to take online Kognito training and fill out response survey
by May, 2018. We will do this in order to test the efficacy of the thirty three thousand dollar
 program, with grant funds coming from the student Wellness Fee Committee. If the program
 has demonstrated that it will make an impact on mental health stigma and referral rates
 at the Cal campus, then we will seek to mandate the program.</p>
